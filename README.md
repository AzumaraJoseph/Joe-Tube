# Joe-Tube
Joe-Tube is a personal project inspired by YouTube, designed to replicate a video-sharing platform where users can view and interact with videos. The videos and comments are hardcoded, making it a static version of YouTube. This project leverages vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for the front-end development, aiming to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube.
